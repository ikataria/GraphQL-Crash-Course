## How to Run the Project

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command to start the server with nodemon:

- **bash**
nodemon index.js

## How to Test the GraphQL Endpoint
Once the server is running:
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:<port> (replace <port> with the port number your server is listening on).

This will open the Apollo Serverâ€™s GraphQL playground where you can test queries and mutations.

}
